L. annulata_reference.PNG,L. annulata,ICN_10067.jpg,False,"**Verdict:** NO MATCH  **Justification:** The candidate image only shows the body, preventing comparison of head morphology and scale patterns with the reference images (C, D, E). Regarding the body pattern, the candidate image displays irregular, somewhat blocky, and confluent dorsal blotches forming a wavy dark band. This does not clearly match the key text description of *Leptodeira annulata*, which specifies ""First dorsal blotch with half-moon shape generally fused with other dorsal blotches in the first third of body forming a zigzag pattern."" The blotches in the candidate image do not appear to be half-moon shaped, nor do they clearly form a distinct zigzag pattern."
L. annulata_reference.PNG,L. annulata,ICN_11065.jpg,False,"**VERDICT:** NO MATCH  **JUSTIFICATION:** The Candidate Image does not match the characteristics of *Leptodeira annulata* based on the provided reference materials.  1.  **Head Features:** The ""head"" portion of the Candidate Image lacks the distinct, large eyes and intricate scale patterns visible in the Reference Image (C, D, E). The markings on the head of the candidate are amorphous and do not show the specific blotches (e.g., arrow-like or lyre-shaped) characteristic of *Leptodeira annulata*. 2.  **Body Pattern:** The Key Text Description specifies that *Leptodeira annulata* has a ""First dorsal blotch with half-moon shape generally fused with other dorsal blotches in the first third of body forming a zigzag pattern."" The Candidate Image shows distinct, somewhat diamond-shaped or transverse blotches that are separated, not fused, and do not form a zigzag pattern."
L. annulata_reference.PNG,L. annulata,ICN_12300.jpg,,"**Verdict:** MATCH  **Justification:** The head morphology in the Candidate Image, particularly the intricate and somewhat irregular dark blotching on the dorsal surface, is consistent with the head patterns observed in the Reference Images (C and D) of *Leptodeira annulata*. While the Candidate Image is a high-contrast black and white rendering, the *texture* and *distribution* of these markings are similar. Furthermore, the anterior dorsal body pattern visible in the Candidate Image displays distinct blotches that appear to be fused and form an irregular, somewhat zigzag pattern along the body, which directly aligns with the Key Text Description: ""First dorsal blotch with half-moon shape generally fused with other dorsal blotches in the first third of body forming a zigzag pattern."""

While the high-contrast nature of the Candidate Image makes a direct comparison of minute head scale patterns challenging, the general head morphology and the presence of a distinct dark blotch on the head and nape are broadly consistent with the head features shown in the Reference Image. The defining body pattern strongly supports the identification."
L. annulata_reference.PNG,L. ashmeadii,ICN_11520.jpg,False,"NO MATCH.  **Justification:**  The Candidate Image does not match *Leptodeira annulata*. The head morphology in the Candidate Image appears much wider and more bulbous relative to the neck than the more tapered heads shown in the Reference Image (C, D, E).

In contrast, the candidate image displays distinct, separate dorsal blotches that are not fused into a zigzag and the first blotch does not appear to be half-moon shaped. While the general head shape and dark crown area in the candidate image share some resemblance to the reference images C, D, and E (particularly D and E with their dark head markings), the definitive lack of the described zigzag body pattern makes it a no match."
L. annulata_reference.PNG,L. ashmeadii,ICN_14305.jpg,True,"**MATCH**  The candidate image is a match for *Leptodeira annulata*.  **Explanation:**  *   **Head Morphology (Match):** Although the candidate image is black and white, the head shape is broadly consistent with the reference images (C, D, E).

The dark blotches are fused or nearly fused along the vertebral line, creating a prominent zigzag pattern down the first third of the body, which is a key diagnostic feature for *Leptodeira annulata*."
L. annulata_reference.PNG,L. ashmeadii,ICN_14306.jpg,False,"**VERDICT:** NO MATCH  **JUSTIFICATION:** The candidate image does not match *Leptodeira annulata* primarily due to significant differences in the dorsal body pattern. The reference text describes the characteristic dorsal pattern of *Leptodeira annulata* as having a ""First dorsal blotch with half-moon shape generally fused with other dorsal blotches in the first third of body forming a zigzag pattern."" The candidate image, however, displays a pattern of distinct, broad, irregular dark blotches or bands separated by narrower light interspaces, lacking the described half-moon shaped first blotch and the overall zigzag fusion. While the head features in the candidate image are somewhat obscured, the visible head shape also appears to differ from the broader head morphology seen in the reference images C, D, and E of *Leptodeira annulata*."
L. annulata_reference.PNG,L. ashmeadii,ICN_147.png,False,"**VERDICT:** NO MATCH  **JUSTIFICATION:** The Candidate Image lacks the diagnostic head features for comparison with the *Leptodeira annulata* reference head. More importantly, the dorsal pattern in the Candidate Image does not clearly exhibit the ""first dorsal blotch with half-moon shape generally fused with other dorsal blotches in the first third of body forming a zigzag pattern"" as described for *Leptodeira annulata*. Instead, the Candidate Image shows a series of somewhat distinct, irregular dark dorsal blotches or saddles that do not form a pronounced zigzag pattern characteristic of the target species."
L. annulata_reference.PNG,L. ashmeadii,ICN_2584.png,True,"**MATCH**  The Candidate Image is a match for *Leptodeira annulata*.  **Justification:**  *   **Head:** While the high-contrast black and white nature of the Candidate Image makes precise scale pattern comparison difficult, the general head shape and presence of darker areas around the eyes are consistent with the reference images (C, D, E) of *Leptodeira annulata*. No features in the visible head morphology contradict the reference. *   **Body Pattern:** The Candidate Image strongly matches the Key Text Description. It clearly shows a prominent dorsal blotch immediately behind the head that has a curved, somewhat ""half-moon"" anterior edge. This blotch is distinctly fused with subsequent dorsal blotches, forming a clear and unmistakable zigzag pattern along the anterior third of the body. This specific pattern is diagnostic for *Leptodeira annulata* as described."
L. annulata_reference.PNG,L. ashmeadii,TAS_2435.jpg,True,"**MATCH**  **Justification:** The Candidate Image, despite its stylized nature, displays a dorsal body pattern highly consistent with *Leptodeira annulata*. Specifically, the distinct dorsal blotches are visibly fused in the anterior portion of the body, forming a clear zigzag pattern, which directly matches the key text description: ""First dorsal blotch with half-moon shape generally fused with other dorsal blotches in the first third of body forming a zigzag pattern."" While specific head scale details are obscured by the high-contrast rendering, the overall head shape and the pronounced body pattern strongly support this identification."
L. annulata_reference.PNG,L. ashmeadii,TAS_2496.jpg,False,"**VERDICT:** NO MATCH  **JUSTIFICATION:** While the overall head shape in the Candidate Image is somewhat consistent with a colubrid, specific head scale patterns and eye characteristics cannot be definitively compared due to the low resolution and high contrast nature of the image.  However, the dorsal body pattern in the Candidate Image does not match the Key Text Description for *Leptodeira annulata*. The description states ""First dorsal blotch with half-moon shape generally fused with other dorsal blotches in the first third of body forming a zigzag pattern."" In the Candidate Image, the first dorsal blotch is a broad, irregular dark patch and does not clearly show a distinct ""half-moon shape."" Furthermore, while there are irregular dark blotches that are somewhat connected, they form broad, staggered bands rather than the characteristic ""zigzag pattern"" described for *Leptodeira annulata*. The pattern in the candidate image appears much chunkier and less intricate than the described zigzag."
L. annulata_reference.PNG,L. ashmeadii,TAS_2570.jpg,False,"**VERDICT:** NO MATCH  **JUSTIFICATION:** While the general head shape in the Candidate Image is somewhat consistent with the dorsal view of *Leptodeira annulata* shown in the Reference Image, the body pattern in the Candidate Image does not match the Key Text Description.

In contrast, the Candidate Image displays distinct, somewhat rectangular or saddle-shaped dorsal blotches that are separated and do not form a continuous zigzag pattern."
L. annulata_reference.PNG,L. ashmeadii,TAS_2633.jpg,True,"MATCH.  **Justification:**  The Candidate Image shows a head morphology consistent with *Leptodeira annulata*, featuring a moderately distinct head with a dorsal pattern on the parietals/occiput that broadly aligns with the darker markings seen in the reference images (D and E). Crucially, the anterior body pattern in the Candidate Image displays dark blotches that are irregular and clearly fused, forming a zigzag pattern.

L. annulata_reference.PNG,L. ashmeadii,TAS_2758.jpg,False,"**VERDICT: NO MATCH**  **Justification:** The candidate image does not match *Leptodeira annulata* based on the following observations:  1.  **Head Scalation and Morphology:** The head scales in the candidate image, particularly on the posterior part of the head and neck, appear much smaller, more numerous, and granular, giving a rough texture. In contrast, the reference images of *Leptodeira annulata* (C, D, E) show relatively larger, smoother head scales. The overall head shape in the candidate image also appears less distinct from the neck and more elongated than the broader heads shown in the reference. 2.  **Head Pattern:** The dark pattern on the head of the candidate snake is complex and irregular, consisting of many small, interconnected dark markings. This does not align with the characteristic, more defined ""butterfly"" or ""arrowhead"" shaped patterns often seen on the head of *Leptodeira annulata* in the reference images. 3.  **Dorsal Body Pattern:** The anterior body pattern in the candidate image is composed of irregular, fragmented dark blotches that are highly mottled and somewhat reticulated.

L. approximans_reference.PNG,L. ashmeadii,TAS_2570.jpg,False,"**NO MATCH**  **Explanation:** The head morphology of the snake in the Candidate Image is fundamentally different from *Leptodeira annulata*. The Candidate Image shows a very blunt, spade-like, heavily armored or keeled head that is not distinctly set off from the neck, characteristic of a fossorial snake (e.g., blind snake).

In the Reference Image (C, E), the occipital region is indeed light brown, with a somewhat lighter medial area. However, the occipital region (topmost part) of the Candidate Image is predominantly solid dark/black, not light brown, and does not show a distinct medial wide line as described. 3.  **Dorsal Pattern (Body):** While the general body pattern in the Candidate Image (dark dorsal blotches interrupted by a lighter vertebral line) is consistent with many phenotypes of *Leptodeira annulata*, the inability to verify critical head features from the reference image and the direct contradiction of the occipital region pattern described in the key text lead to a ""NO MATCH"" for species verification."

This dark head is then immediately followed by a prominent *light* band on the nape. This arrangement of light and dark areas on the head and nape is a direct reversal of the pattern observed in the reference images. 2.  **Key Text Description (""occipital region light brown with medial wide line""):** While the reference images show a dark medial pattern on the occipital/nape area, the overall pattern (lighter anterior head, dark nape) is more consistent with *Leptodeira annulata*. The Candidate Image, with its uniformly dark dorsal head transitioning to a light nape band, does not fit this description, nor does it align with the visual pattern of the reference material for *Leptodeira annulata*. 3.  **Body Pattern:** The general banded pattern of the body in the candidate image is broadly consistent with *Leptodeira annulata*, but the distinct difference in head and nape coloration and pattern is a critical distinguishing feature."

In contrast, the reference images (C, D, E, F) show the head of *Leptodeira annulata* as moderately distinct from the neck but more streamlined, not nearly as wide or blunt. Furthermore, no distinct eye features or scale patterns (like supralabials or parietals) are visible on the candidate's head, which are key characteristics for species identification.  2.  **Dorsal Pattern:** The key text description states ""occipital region light brown with medial wide line."" The candidate image, immediately behind the head, displays a pattern of stark, irregular black and white transverse bands or blotches. This banded pattern does not align with the description of a ""medial wide line"" on a light brown occipital region.

While the Reference Images (C and E) support this with a generally lighter brown occipital area, the Candidate Image shows a dark occipital region (the back of the head). This directly contradicts the characteristic described. 3.  **Dorsal Pattern (first band):** While *Leptodeira annulata* does have dorsal bands, the overall pattern and initial band immediately following the head in the Candidate Image, combined with the head shape and occipital color, are not consistent with the reference materials."

The highly stylized and coarse nature of the candidate image also prevents detailed comparison of scale patterns and eye characteristics, but the overall head shape and pattern are inconsistent."
